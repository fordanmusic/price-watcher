# Notes
###
# - Build a 'web scraping pipeline'
# - make sure that you’re not violating any Terms of Service
# - One challenge is variety. Every website is different.
# - Another challenge is durability. Websites constantly change.
# - You can set up continuous integration to run scraping tests periodically
#   to ensure that your main script doesn’t break without your knowledge.
